# 🧩 Custom Data Structures in Java
This repository showcases a curated collection of core data structures implemented from scratch in Java, without the use of built-in collection classes such as ArrayList, LinkedList, Queue, or Stack. Each implementation reflects a deep dive into how these structures function under the hood, providing greater clarity on memory management, pointer manipulation, and algorithmic design.

These data structures were designed and built during focused problem-solving sessions and serve as a strong foundation for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for academic, interview, and practical programming purposes.

# 🗃️ Implementations Included
Data Structure	Implementation Details
Linked List	Singly linked list with recursive and iterative insertion methods, node manipulation, cycle detection, and middle element finding
Stack	Array-based implementation supporting push/pop/peek operations, overflow/underflow checks
Queue	Circular queue using arrays with full/empty condition checks and efficient space utilization
Binary Tree	Custom tree node class with traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder), height and depth utilities
Heap	Min and Max Heap implemented using arrays with heapify operations, insertions, deletions, and tree visualization support

# 🎯 Learning Objectives
Deepen Conceptual Understanding: By not using Java’s built-in libraries, these implementations reinforce fundamental DSA concepts such as pointer references, recursion, and data layout in memory.

Object-Oriented Design Practice: Clean, modular class-based designs to improve fluency in Java OOP principles.

Interview Preparation: These files serve as a reusable codebase to revise core topics for technical interviews and coding assessments.

Debugging and Optimization Skills: Understanding time and space complexity in custom code builds stronger debugging and profiling skills.

# 🔍 Highlights

Recursion-heavy techniques used where appropriate (e.g., recursive insertion in linked lists and trees).

Error handling included for edge cases like stack overflow, queue underflow, etc.

Modular code organization — each structure has its own folder and clear class separation.

# 🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository and open any data structure’s folder to access the main Java class file:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Custom-DSA-Library.git
cd Custom-DSA-Library/LinkedList
javac CustomLinkedList.java
java CustomLinkedList
